  One of the coolest (IMHO) new features [1] recently added to OpenStackClient is its leveraging of a new-ish feature of Keystone's client library, authentication plugins. As that name implies, this allows for Keystone client to be able to use an extendable set of authentication backends for validating users. At press time (keypress time for the pedantic) the freshly released python-keystoneclient 0.11.2 includes the traditional password method, a new variant on the token method and a recent addition supporting SAML2. Happily, the master branch of OpenStackClient has learned how to take advantage of these plugins, plus any additional ones written for

  OpenStack Terms and You I think we need to start from the beginning to know a bit about where we really are...and to do that we need to speak the same language. This doesn't mean we must agree on the actual terms used, but that their definition and evidence of need are spelled out and can inform the following steps and discussion. In some cases, the bikeshed will simply be in primer with placeholders until we converge an appropriate terms. The Technical Committee Charter refers to some terms that should be clarified early in this process. Official Programs - The

  So back in the old days I started throwing around different terminology to describe some of the technical relationships between OpenStack projects because it was useful to sort out things like startup order requirements in DevStack and other semi-obvious stuff. And wow have things happened since then. To recap, oh nevermind, I'm just going to take back the term layer for technical use and propose anything else other than layer 1 (there is no other layer?) for the rest of the conversation. The various alternate approaches all boil down to a nucleus with a cloud (heh) of projects with probabilistic

  The current Python library situation for OpenStack is, sorry to say, a mess. Cleaning it up requires essentially starting over and abstracting the individual REST APIs to usable levels. With OpenStackClient I started from the top and worked down to make the CLI a better experience. I think we have proved that to be a worthwhile task. Now it is time to start from the bottom and work up. The existing libraries utilize a Manager/Resource model that may be suitable for application work, but every project's client repo was forked and changed so they are all similar but maddeningly different.

  I've been playing with OpenWRT since <mumble>-<mumble> and have enjoyed building some of the smallest Linux images around. While targeted at low-end home router platforms, it also runs on a wide variety of small SoC boards including the near-ubiqutious Raspberry Pi and my fave BeagleBone Black. I've also been using an incredibly tiny OpenWRT instance on my laptop for years now to work around the 'interesting' network configuration of VirtualBox. Building a set of VMs that need to talk to each other and to the outside world shouldn't be hard, so I added a router just like I have at

Other Docs Building Windows VM images is a topic that has been done to death, but the working consensus of those I've talked to is that Florent Flament's post is one of the best guides through this minefield.

  There is no shortage of articles online about building Windows images for use in various clouds. What there is a shortage of are working articles on building these images unattended. The Windows unattended install process has been basically solved, even if still a bit arcane. But finding more than a trivial example of doing it in a cloud is sparse. Cloudbase has shared the tooling they created for building their Windows images. That makes a good base for an automated build process that can be tailored to your particular needs. in addition to being the authors of cloudbase-init, their GitHub

  [Work In Progress, you have been warned] So clients are like pie. Creamy, gooey, butterscotch cream pie with meringue. Known at the in-laws house as Baby Bear Pie for reasons unknown-to-me. Meringue is yummy but not much by itself. Pie crust does its job most of the time without being noticed, unless it is sub-par. It's the cream filling that gets all of the attention. Butterscotch, lemon or chocolate, that's where the glory is. REST clients are like pie, what with their multiple layers of communication handlers, data marshallers and output formatters and all. So lets talk client crust. It

  OpenStackClient (OSC) has been in my project queue for almost two years now. It was Feb 2012 that I stayed up all night mucking about with something called DrStack with the goal of combining the then four OpenStack CLI binaries into a single command set. OSC is the second major realization of that goal having a greatly improved internal command architecture courtesy of dhellmann's Cliff framework. It also somehow got an informal blessing without becoming an official project, a status that it still carries. We have a roadmap of where to go with that but that is a topic for

  OpenStack has had a global reach since the early days but the Design Summits have always been a US-based affair. Last week we finally took the every-six-month roadshow off-continent and ventured out to Hong Kong. Of course the Conference is co-located and concurrent but I didn't make it to any of those sessions this time and only knew it was there by going to lunch in the expo hall and seeing some familiar vendor faces. We begin with the projects most subject to my attention, DevStack, Grenade and OpenStackClient. DevStack This is the first summit where DevStack has program status

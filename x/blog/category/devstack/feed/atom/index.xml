    <content type="html" xml:base="http://hackstack.org/x/blog/2013/09/07/devstack-local-config"><![CDATA[<div class="document">
<p>DevStack has long had an extremely simple mechanism to add arbitrary configuration entries to nova.con, <tt class="docutils literal">EXTRA_OPTS</tt>.  It was handy and even emulated in the Neutron configuration in a number of places.  However, it did not scale well: a new variable and expansion loop is required for each file/section combination.  And now the time has come for a replacement...</p>
<div class="section" id="requirements">
<h1>Requirements</h1>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">localrc</tt> has served well in its capacity of the sole container of local configuration.  Being a single file makes it easy to track and share known working DevStack configurations.  Any new configuration scheme must at least attempt to preserve this property.</li>
<li>In order to be able to set configuration attributes in arbitrary files and sections, those bits of information must be encoded in the new format.</li>
<li>There must be a mechanism to selectively merge the configuration values into their destination files rather than do them all at once.</li>
<li>Reduce the number of configuration variables in general that are simply passed-through to project config files.  They are being set in localrc anyway, moving that to another section of local.conf is not a difficult transition.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="solution">
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>A new master local configuration file is supported (but like <tt class="docutils literal">localrc</tt> is not included in the DevStack repo) that all local configuration for DevStack, including the master copy of <tt class="docutils literal">localrc</tt>.  <tt class="docutils literal">local.conf</tt> is an extended-INI format that introduces a new meta-section header that contains the additional required information: a group name and destination configuration filename.  It has the form:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[[ &lt;group&gt; | &lt;filename&gt; ]]
</pre>
<p>where &lt;group&gt; is the usual DevStack project name (<tt class="docutils literal">nova</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">cinder</tt>, etc) and &lt;filename&gt; is the config filename.  The filename is eval'ed in the <tt class="docutils literal">stack.sh</tt> context so all environment variables are available and may be used (see example below).</p>
<p>The file is processed strictly in sequence.  Meta-sections may be specified more than once, if any settings are duplicated the last to appear in the file will be used:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[[nova|$NOVA_CONF]]
[DEFAULT]
use_syslog = True

[osapi_v3]
enabled = False
</pre>
<p>A special meta-section <tt class="docutils literal">[[local:localrc]]</tt> is used to provide a default localrc file.  This allows all custom settings for DevStack to be contained in a single file:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[[local|localrc]]
FIXED_RANGE=10.254.1.0/24
ADMIN_PASSWORD=speciale
LOGFILE=$DEST/logs/stack.sh.log
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="implementation">
<h1>Implementation</h1>
<p>Four new functions were added to parse and merge <tt class="docutils literal">local.conf</tt> into the existing INI-style config files.  The base <tt class="docutils literal">functions</tt> file is getting way too large so these functions are in <tt class="docutils literal">lib/config</tt> which will only contain functions related to config file manipulation.  There shall also be no side-effects from any of these functions.  The existing <tt class="docutils literal">iniXXX()</tt> functions may also eventually move here.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">get_meta_section()</tt> - Returns an INI fragment for a specific group/filename combination</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">get_meta_section_files()</tt> - Returns a list of the config filenames present in <tt class="docutils literal">local.conf</tt> for a specific group</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">merge_config_file()</tt> - Performs the actual merge of the INI fragment from <tt class="docutils literal">local.conf</tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">merge_config_group()</tt> - Loops over the INI fragments present for the specified group and merges them</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The merge is performed after the <tt class="docutils literal">install_XXX()</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">configure_XXX()</tt> functions for all layer 1 and 2 projects are complete and before any services are started.</p>

<div class="section" id="use-it-or-lose-it">
<h1>Use It Or Lose It</h1>
<p>The list of existing variables that will be deprecated in favor of using <tt class="docutils literal">local.conf</tt> has not been completed yet but includes <tt class="docutils literal">EXTRA_OPTS</tt> and a handful of <tt class="docutils literal">Q_XXX_XXX_OPTS</tt> variables in Neutron.  These are listed at the end of <tt class="docutils literal">stack.sh</tt> runs as deprecated and will be removed sometime in the Icehouse development cycle after DevStack's stable/havana branch is in place and Grenade's Grizzly-&gt;Havana upgrade is operational.</p>

    <content type="html" xml:base="http://hackstack.org/x/blog/2012/12/21/securing-openstack-client-connections-part-2"><![CDATA[<div class="document">
<p>In the first part of this series we covered creating a pair of certificate authorities and a signed certificate with the same attributes commonly found in commercial certificates.  This part covers the OpenStack Python clients and proper certificate verification.</p>
<p>The OpenStack client repositories (or packages) include both the Python API bindings and the reference command line interface (CLI) implementation to communicate with the OpenStack APIs.   Client support for modern encrypted connections, i.e SSLv3 and/or TLSv1, has been spotty at best.</p>
<p>Most of the clients are capable of using SSL for encryption but often the certificate verification part of the protocol did not work properly for tier-2 or privately signed certificates, prompting the addition of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--insecure</span></tt> option to some of the clients to sidestep the problem altogether.  In addition, most of the clients had no mechanism to specify an alternate CA bundle file to enable certificate verification for certificates not signed by the commercial CAs.</p>
<p>Python has historically had incomplete X.509 certificate support in its standard library.  For example, <tt class="docutils literal">ssl</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">httplib</tt> do not verify the hostname as part of certificate verification. Four of the clients (keystone, nova, cinder, quantum) use <tt class="docutils literal">httplib2</tt> which had no hostname verification before version 0.7.0 and what it currently has is also incomplete. The other two clients (glance and swift) use <tt class="docutils literal">httplib</tt> directly and either have no hostname verification (swift) or implement it locally (glance).</p>
<div class="section" id="issue-summary">
<h1>Issue Summary</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Python's <tt class="docutils literal">ssl</tt> module does no certificate hostname verification in 2.7.x; it has been added in 3.2 but will not be backported. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id1">[1]</a></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">ssl</tt> is pinned to using protocol version <tt class="docutils literal">SSLv23</tt> and must be directly patched to override it.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">httplib</tt> uses <tt class="docutils literal">ssl</tt> and adds no hostname verification.  In addition it only uses the default <tt class="docutils literal">SSLV23</tt> protocol version set by <tt class="docutils literal">ssl</tt>.  We don't want this as SSLv2 is deprecated and insecure.  Patching that value directly into the <tt class="docutils literal">ssl</tt> module works but is suboptimal.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">httplib2</tt> implements a basic hostname verification but it has some problems such as only checking <tt class="docutils literal">commonName</tt> if the certificate's <tt class="docutils literal">subjectAltNames</tt> is not present and handling wildcards differently than specified in RFC-2818.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">httplib2</tt> uses an internal ca bundle (<tt class="docutils literal">cacert.txt</tt>) if the <tt class="docutils literal">ca_certs</tt> argument is not given to <tt class="docutils literal">HTTPSConnectionWithTimeout.__init__()</tt>.</li>
<li>In other news, <tt class="docutils literal">httplib2</tt> only supports 3xx redirects for GET method.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="additional-notes">
<h2>Additional Notes</h2>
<p>glanceclient has patched the <tt class="docutils literal">ssl</tt> module out of <tt class="docutils literal">httplib</tt> in favor of <tt class="docutils literal">pyOpenSSL</tt>.  Stuart McLaren added <tt class="docutils literal">http.VerifiedHTTPSConnection.host_matches_cert()</tt> to validate <tt class="docutils literal">commonName</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">subjectAltName</tt> for <tt class="docutils literal">httplib</tt> connections but it doesn't handle wildcards.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-requests-2">
<h1>Why requests? <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id2">[2]</a></h1>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">requests</tt> module backported <tt class="docutils literal">match_hostname()</tt> from Python 3.2.  Like the rest of the modules here it does not handle the <tt class="docutils literal">iPAddress</tt> attribute in <tt class="docutils literal">subjectAltName</tt>. This is mostly relevant in development and testing use cases like with DevStack.  The 3.2 <tt class="docutils literal">match_hostname()</tt> implementation however does allow IP addresses as a <tt class="docutils literal">dNSName</tt>.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">requests</tt> also brings a number of other features to the table that may or may not have been implemented individually in the existing clients such as JSON encoding/decoding and 3xx redirection support for POST, PUT, PATCH DELETE, and HEAD.  Plus it is stable (notwithstanding the recent 1.0 release) and the developer is known in the OS community.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-cli-solution">
<h1>The CLI Solution</h1>
<p>There has recently been a round of patches to the CLIs to get them all up to the same level of support for TLSv1 to be used for authentication at a minimum.  Glance and Swift continue to use <tt class="docutils literal">httplib</tt> directly for their data transfer connections (really, all connections to their respective services) and these already support SSLv3.</p>

</table>
<p>The approach taken for the <tt class="docutils literal">httplib2</tt> subclasses is to change the parent class to <tt class="docutils literal">object</tt> and rework the <tt class="docutils literal">request()</tt> method to call <tt class="docutils literal">requests.request()</tt>.  Some of the differences for <tt class="docutils literal">requests</tt> leaked out of that method but have been mostly containd within the <tt class="docutils literal">HTTPClient</tt> class.  All four of the clients (formerly) using <tt class="docutils literal">httplib2</tt> have implemented one or more features that can easily be handled by <tt class="docutils literal">requests</tt> (redirection) or should also be propogated to the other clients.  This is ripe for a refactor of <tt class="docutils literal">HTTPClient</tt> to a common module but that effort is not in scope here.</p>

<p>We all know that the difference between <tt class="docutils literal">https</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">http</tt> is the addition of encryption, right?  Of course, but less attention is paid to the other purposes of SSL and TLS: to verify one or both of the parties involved in the connection and to validate that the objects used in the verification meet certain criteria. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id1">[1]</a>  In the common case of a user directing a web browser to a 'secure' site, only one side is potentially validated, that being the server.  Maybe.</p>
<p>Browsers generally go a good job of performing server certificate verification and validation but other https clients may not do so well.  Sometimes the web browser will pop up a box saying that the server is untrusted for one reason or another.  This can be the result of a failure to validate the server certificate or verifying that the name used to reach the server matches who the server claims to be.  It will usually contain the reason for the failure but generally it also contains a button to click on that allows the connection to proceed.  This effectively neuters the validation process and opens the door for server spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>
<p>The point here is not to rehash the merits of that behaviour but to investigate the use of <tt class="docutils literal">https</tt> in the OpenStack Python clients and to validate their certificate verification.  And validation.  Mmmmmm...recursion...</p>
<div class="section" id="but-first">
<h1>But First</h1>
<p>Before we can delve into the world of Python modules and SSL wrappers we must first have a way to test against some known secure servers.  This means uncorking some OpenSSL-foo and entering the dark world of certificate authorities (CA).  &quot;But that's been covered to death!&quot; you may say.  Yes it has <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id2">[2]</a>, but generally only to the level of self-sigining a cert for use in private servers.  I believe the common name for these certs is 'snakeoil'.  However, certificates in the real world are not only self-signed, but often signed by a CA that is itself signed by one or more parent CAs.  The root CA certificates are included in the lists shipped with most operating systems, browsers and even some programming libraries.</p>
<p>Our goal then is to build a server certificate that is a) signed by an intermediate CA and b) has the basic attributes and extensions common in real-world certificates.  To get that we need a root CA and an intermediate CA.  To get that we need some shell scripts and OpenSSL configuration files for each operation.</p>
<p>Note that in this exercise we do not encrypt the private keys as this is all used for development and testing of the SSL/TLS connections and should not be used for production.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="root-ca">
<h1>Root CA</h1>
<p>A self-signed certificate has the unique characteristic of the Issuer matches the Subject.  Creating a self-signed root CA is a common operation and has been covered many times elsewhere.  So here are the basics:</p>
<ul>

<p>First birthdays are always fun...especially the bit where the birthday kidlet is encouraged to make a mess of the cake to the mild amusement of the adults present.  At least that's how it worked in the little burg where I grew up.  (Little burg?  Isn't that redundant?)  My parents have pictures of me doing that, I have pictures of my kids doing that, I anticipate the cycle will continue someday.</p>
<p>Now that the <a class="reference external" href="http://openstack.org">OpenStack</a> Grizzly Design Summit is over I realize that <a class="reference external" href="devstack.org">DevStack</a> is just over a year old, having been shown off for the first time at the Essex Design Summit in Boston.  We should have had a party!  Maybe I'll just retroactively declare one of the many during the week to be DevStack's birthday party.  Anyone care to vote on which one? (<em>cough*Nebula*cough</em>)  Look, DevStack still has a little cache on its face, how cute!</p>
<p>anotherjesse and sleepsonthefloor initially started building DevStack to address their own needs for OpenStack development and exploration.  They were scratching an itch as the saying goes, and it soon became apparent that this might be generally useful.  Over its first year DevStack has become the de facto quick way to build an OpenStack cloud for developers.  While it was (and still is) primarily targeted for development use it has been found in other interesting places, most promintely in the OpenStack Continuous Integration gating tests.</p>
<p>The original goals of DevStack remain as its primary guide:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>provide an environment for development and basic testing of OpenStack with and quick turnaround times and easy access to debug logs and output</li>
<li>provide an example of one way to configure OpenStack and provide a simple mechanism to try different configurations</li>
<li>support multiple deployment environments (bare metal, VMs, ramdisk, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>We have largely stayed true to those goals and IMHO achieved them in large part.  As new uses of DevStack have come to light we added</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>provide a basic platform for CI testing and gating of OpenStack commits</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="what-just-happened">
<h1>What Just Happened?</h1>
<p>Honestly it feels like not much has happened on DevStack since I started working on Grenade.  In reality, I look at the commits and see some significant developments that are worth noting for those who don't spend their coffee breaks looking at commit logs.  In early October we split off a stable/folsom branch of DevStack and configured it to pull stable/folsom branches from the project repos.  Everything below happened before stable/folsom was created.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Tell stack.sh to shut up!</strong>  The logging in <tt class="docutils literal">stack.sh</tt> was re-worked to allow writing the familiar xtrace stream to the <tt class="docutils literal">stack.sh.log</tt> files but only display a limited number of status messages in the console window.  Set <tt class="docutils literal">VERBOSE=False</tt> in <tt class="docutils literal">localrc</tt> to relieve your eyes from having to look at that stream that is busier than a VMS boot log.</li>
<li><strong>Ceilometer and HEAT are now available!</strong>  You can now incorporate both projects into your DevStack install in the same install-from-source mode that the other projects use.</li>
<li><strong>Cinder is the default volume service!</strong>  Nova volumes will take a powder sometime during Grizzly so we're using that new kid, Cinder, to provide block storage.  Stop by and see how jgriffith is doing, maybe he'll put you on a horse.</li>
<li><strong>Get smarter about loading images into Glance from IMAGE_URLS!</strong>  It is the little things in life, like properly set image disk types in Glance, that make the difference between 'Life Is Good' and 'Life Is Pretty Good'.  What's next, setting the sticky bit on public images?</li>
<li><strong>Exclamation points are on clearance!</strong>  Just checking to see if you were paying attention.  Unfortunately the only ones left are all in Comic Sans.</li>
<li><strong>Keystone backend is SQL by default!</strong>  <tt class="docutils literal">default_catalog.templates</tt> is dead, long live <tt class="docutils literal">default_catalog.templates</tt>!  Unless of course you set <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">KEYSTONE_CATALOG_BACKEND=not-sql</span></tt> (really, we test for 'sql' so anything else resurrects the old way).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="near-term-development">
<h1>Near-term Development</h1>
<p>I can her you thinking &quot;OK, all that is well and good, but what have you done for me today?&quot;  Humph.  Lurking in design summit sessions that decide the future of OpenStack's DNS strategy or hallway^H^H^H^H^H^HDeveloper Lounge conversations about how to refactor MySQL configuration in <tt class="docutils literal">stack.sh</tt> or scruitinizing the debut of Dope'n'Stack's latest release or dutifully searching for non-coffee-or-tea-based caffeine isn't enough?</p>
<p>We added some important things from the design summit to the list, presented here in no particular order so don't get any ideas:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>sdague's arm should be straightened out by the time he returns home and begins doing core reviews on DevStack.  <em>[Ed: After further review it seems that he didn't wait.]</em></li>
<li>In other sdague news, he is also planning to implement support for PostgreSQL.  And factor out the aforementioned MySQL support from <tt class="docutils literal">stack.sh</tt> in the process.</li>
<li>That pesky new kid Grenade wants, nee demands, the completion of the project re-factoring from <tt class="docutils literal">stack.sh</tt> so it can include the results in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">upgrade-*</span></tt> scripts.</li>
<li>Rework the dependency system to be more portable across multiple distros.  Most of the python dependencies are handled by pip out of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tools/pip-requires</span></tt> files in the project source trees but the remaining packaged dependencies need to be specified per-project to ensure they are present when that project is enabled.  The existing system is simple but maybe a little too simple especially to support differences between multiple RPM-based distros (hello OpenSUSE!)</li>
<li>Finalize Quantal support.  Actually that may be done already but someone should check before he shoots his mouth off and says it is done.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wild-hares">
<h1>Wild Hares</h1>
<p>Try these ideas on for size:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>sliced bread</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.alibaba.com/showroom/inflatable-dart-board.html">inflatable dart board</a></li>
<li>GOTO</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Coke">New Coke</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Not everything is a good idea and not everything makes it into the master branch which means often good ideas don't make the cut.  Whether good or bad, here are some ideas suggested for DevStack that will not be implemented and here is why:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Rewrite in Python?</strong> One of the primary goals of DevStack is to demonstrate one simple way to set up OpenStack.  We feel that is best served using shell scripts that are accessible to more people, especially to implementors who are not developers.</li>
<li><strong>Start/run services under upstart/init/whatever?</strong> The OpenStack services run in screen to simplify developer access to stop and re-start the services during the development cycle.</li>
<li><strong>Install OpenStack from packages?</strong> This mode becomes extremely hard to convert a project from using the packaged code to a repo checked out from GitHub.  There may be enough demand to warrant wrapping the Ubuntu or Fedora package installs with some default configuration that produces an end-result similar to DevStack but we're going to leave that for someon else to tackle.</li>
